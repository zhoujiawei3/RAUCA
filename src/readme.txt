Description of the code used for the experiment:
	generate_texture.py : used for texture generation
	NRP_train.py : used for NRP training

Neural renderer deployment is required before the start of the experimentï¼Œwe use the following neural renderer from https://github.com/winterwindwang/neural_renderer?tab=readme-ov-file

We provide our generated textures in /textures
