### before running

### Install the following python package before run the code.

> before you running the code, you must install the `neural renderer` python package. You can pull Wang's implementation [here](https://github.com/winterwindwang/neural_renderer), which is slight different to daniilidis.

you also perpare:
- dataset
  + The dataset can be generated by CARLA, which is a 3D virtual simulated environment and a commonly used 
  open-source simulator for autonomous driving research.
- 3d object `.obj` and texture file `.mtl`
- face id list `.txt` which need to be trained
- install all the package in requirements.txt

Description of the core code in our repository:
- generate_texture.py : used for texture generation
- NRP_train.py : used for NRP training
